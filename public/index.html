Vedic Mathematics forms part of Jyotish Shastra, which is one of the six parts of Vedangas.</p><p>Vedic Mathematics is the name given to the ancient system of Indian Mathematics, which was rediscovered from the Vedas between 1911 and 1918 by Sri Bharati Krsna Tirthaji (1884-1960). According to his research, all of mathematics is based on sixteen Sutras, or word-formulae. For example, ‘Vertically and crosswise’ is one of these Sutras. These formulae describe the way the mind naturally works and are therefore a great help in directing the student to the appropriate method of solution.</p><p>The simplicity of Vedic Mathematics means that calculations can be carried out mentally (though the methods can also be written down). There are many advantages in using a flexible, mental system.</p><p>Vedic Maths program is aimed at developing the mental arithmetic ability of children. This program helps children lose the fear of mathematics and gain confidence in the subject. It helps the children in their academics and score better marks in all the subjects due to improved self-confidence.</p>';

Cursive handwriting acts as a connector between letters that form a word, aiding the child in seeing the letters as part of a whole word. Through cursive writing, a child can distinguish between each word more effectively. In cursive courses, all letters are beautifully defined and practiced to develop muscle memory. By the time a child holds a pencil, they can write smoothly and with much better fluency compared to print.</p><p>"An impressive handwriting reflects a strong personality."</p>';

Electronics can help children understand fundamental principles of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), foster creativity, and prepare them for future technological advancements. Some ideas and resources for introducing electronics to school children are:</p><ul><li><strong>Basic Electronics Concepts:</strong> Start with fundamental concepts like electricity, circuits, components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, LEDs), and safety precautions. Use simple analogies and hands-on experiments to explain these concepts.</li><li><strong>Hands-On Projects:</strong> Encourage children to build simple electronic circuits using breadboards or electronic kits designed for beginners. Projects could include creating a basic LED circuit, a simple buzzer circuit, or a light-sensitive circuit. Explain how to read circuit diagrams and schematics, gradually introducing more complex ones as children become comfortable.</li><li><strong>Arduino and Microcontrollers:</strong> Arduino is a popular platform for teaching electronics and programming. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating interactive electronic projects. Start with basic Arduino projects like blinking LEDs or making simple robots</li></ul>';

However, memorizing is not entirely an innate skill but rather an ongoing process one endures over time; it is possible for anyone to train and develop their memorizing abilities. For a concept to move from temporary working memory to long-term memory, there are a number of techniques that can be used. Firstly, understanding the material is essential to memorizing it. A second helpful technique is to connect the information you are trying to commit to memory to something that you already know and understand well. Material in isolation is more difficult to remember than material that is connected to other concepts.</p><p>Memorization techniques often involve repetition. These techniques involve visual aids like flashcards and diagrams to self-test material comprehension. Memorization takes time, and it is suggested to implement these techniques over several days and increase the time in between each study session to test progress and understanding.</p>';
